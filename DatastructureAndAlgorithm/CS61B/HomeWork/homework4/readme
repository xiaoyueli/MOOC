variables:
variables can only invoke the method its static type has, no matter the virtual type.

fields:
fields always depend on the static type when invoked.
super.field equals value of superclass's field even if the virtual object is subclass.

methods:
virtual methods performed always depend on the virtual object, no matter how to cast.
if the actual instance is created by subclass, even if it's been casted to superclass,
the overridden method always executes the method of the subclass, vise versa.
